# Introduction to Linux 


About Linux Operating SystemLinux is a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution.

Linux usually works as a server, because of its stability and security’s feature. Linux programs are extremely advantageous:Linux programs are free, you’ll see, most of Linux programs are.

They are frequently updated and for Zero charge!Some of them are better than those in windows. And other doesn’t evenexist in windows!If  Linux  is  free  and  almost  all  their  softwares  are  free,  it  is  for  a  reason;  tounder stand we have to go back to 1984. 1984 So we are back in 1984, computer science was not very developed.

Microsoft has just launched its first os: MS-DOS, but this one is far away from being done. But, was MS-DOS the only one then?No! There was other operating system but less known by the public. The one that was called the best was “Unix”. It was a lot powerful than MS-DOSbut a lot complicated, what explains that only the professionals could use it.Graphically UNIX looked a lot like MS-DOS they were both seen like a blackscreen with some white text in it. 


We must say that computers back then were not capable of doing better. 



## GNU Project             


It is just in 1984, that Richard Stallman created GNU project.The GNU Project is free software, mass collaboration project, announced on 27 September 1983, by Richard Stallman at MIT. Its aim is to give computer usersfreedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following freedom  rights:  users  are  free  to  run  the  software,  share  it  (copy,  distribute),study it and modify it. 



GNU software guarantees these freedom-rights legally (via its license), and is therefore free software; the use of the word "free" alwaysbeing taken to refer to freedom.Richard Stallman was a researcher in Artificial intelligence in MIT. He wantedto create an operating system based on UNIX (the commands still the same).  

But why would he create a copy of “UNIX”?Because  UNIX  was  not  free  and  it  was  getting  more  expensive!  RichardStallman wanted to react by creating a free alternative: the project GNU wasborn.

GNU is an open operating systemGNU should not only be a free OS; it also had to be "open"What is the difference?A free program is a program where you can have the source code, that is to say,the "batch recipe." In contrast, Windows is a proprietary OS whose source codeis stored by Microsoft. Imagine it's like Coca-Cola: nobody knows the recipe(there are many people who try to imitate it, but hey ...). 

So we cannot change itor see how it works inside.An open program is mostly a free program, it is also a program that has the rightto copy, modify, redistribute. It's a real ideology in computer science: people think it is better to give the source code of the programs that we create because itallows knowledge sharing and helps the computer to evolve faster. The slogan of the Free World might be: "Unity is strength."They  say  whenever  the  program  is  "open  source"  because  its  source  code  isopen;  everyone  can  see  it.  There  are  some  slight  differences  between  "opensource" program and a "free" program, but we will not go into details here.

Linus Torvalds is doing his hobby In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki (Finland), began creating his free own operating system. This system became known as Linux,referring to the name of its creator (Linux is a contraction of Linus and UNIX).

Linus Torvalds, creator of LinuxWhat  relationship  with  GNU?  Well  it  turns  out  that  these  two  projects  werecomplementary:  while  Richard  Stallman  created  the  basic  programs  (program file copy, delete, file, text editor), Linus had embarked on the creation of the"heart" an operating system kernel.

The GNU (free programs) and Linux (OS kernel) project merged to create GNU/ Linux.Theoretically, we should talk about GNU / Linux. But it is a bit difficult to writeand pronounce, and by abuse of language, we often say just "Linux". 


This is why I continue to speak of "Linux" in the rest of the book, even though the politically correct name is "GNU / Linux" because it is the merger of two complementary projects.

Original operating systemsYou should now have a better idea of the origin of the three major operatingsystems that exist today: Mac OS, Linux and Windows. Thus, Mac OS and Linux are both based on UNIX, the ancestor of operating systems, while Windows, from MS-DOS is a separate branch. Overall, this is all you need to remember.

It is said that Mac OS and Linux are based on UNIX because they have "copied"its  operation.  It's  not  pejorative,  it’s  quite  the  opposite:  it's  been  an  honor  to UNIX. Linux programs do not use all the same source code as UNIX (it was also theowner, so private). They have been completely rewritten but work the same way.

If I told you all this is because I believe that knowing the origin of Linux isimportant. This will help you understand many things thereafter.Linux distributions
A Linux distribution (often called distro for short) is an operating system madeas a collection of software based around the Linux kernel and often around apackage management system.  


The most well known distributions are RedHat,SUSE, Debian, Mandriva, Slackware and Ubuntu. You can find much different software and there are hundreds of different ways to install it. To make life easier for users and allow them to make a choice, different Linux distributions  were  created.  This  is  a  concept  that  does  not  really  exist  in Windows. It's like the difference between Windows 7 Home and Windows 7 Professional, but it goes much further than that.


Here's what can differ from one distribution to another:Installation: it can be greatly simplified as very complicated; Installing management programs: If it is done well and centralized, it can make the installation of new software simpler than Windows, as discussed further!The preinstalled programs on your computer (e.g. Windows is bundled with Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player).In fact, distribution is somehow packing Linux. The heart itself remains the samefor all distributions.



Whichever  distribution  you  install,  you  get  a  Linux  compatible  with  others. Some distributions are just more or less easy to handle. :-)Various existing distributions There  are  many  different  Linux  distributions. Hard  to  choose,  you  will  say:indeed, the first time it is unclear what to choose ... especially since all are free!Do not worry; I'll help you make your choice.

I will not list all existing distributions, but here at least the main ones:Slackware: one of the oldest Linux distributions. It still exists today!Mandriva: published by a French company, it is simple to use;RedHat:  published  by  an  American  company,  this  distribution  is  known  andwidespread, especially on servers;SUSE: Novell published by the company;Debian: Debian distribution alone which is managed by independent developers rather than a business. This is one of the most popular distributions.As I have said, whatever the distro (short for distribution) you choose, you will have  a  Linux. 

Basically,  "just"  a  screen  on  first  boot  and  various  softwarepreinstalled (I'm simplifying a bit much, but the idea is there).Summary Windows, Mac OS and Linux are the most popular operating systems.

Linux usually works as a server, because of its stability and security’s feature.Linux has the distinction of being free, that is to say that its source code (the manufacturing recipe) is open: anyone can view it. In contrast, the source codethat was used to design Windows and Mac OS is closed; we say that these are proprietary operating systems.

There are many variants of Linux, called distributions.
